arming is changing in a big way, thanks to smart technology like the Internet of Things (IoT) 
and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These innovations help farmers grow more food while using 
resources wisely and cutting down on waste. 
In recent years, agriculture and the food industry have faced some tough challenges—rising 
costs, a growing population, urban expansion, migration, and unpredictable market trends. With 
so much at stake, investing in smarter farming methods is more important than ever. 
As technology continues to advance, farming needs to keep up. Experts say that by 2050, we’ll 
need to produce 50% more food to feed the world’s growing population. At the same time, 
climate change could reduce crop yields by over 25%. This means smarter farming isn’t just a 
trend—it’s a necessity. 
To get the best results from the land and resources we have, farming must embrace technology. 
Farmers and researchers are already testing new tools in real-world conditions, considering 
different climates and soil types. With IoT and AI, they can gather real-time data from sensors in 
the field and lab studies, helping them make better decisions about their crops. 
This paper introduces a smart farming system that combines IoT and Machine Learning. By 
using IoT sensors, it collects real-time data from the fields, analyzes it, and gives farmers 
valuable insights. These insights help them make better choices about planting, watering, and 
overall farm management. By adopting these technologies, farming can become more efficient, 
sustainable, and ready for the future.
