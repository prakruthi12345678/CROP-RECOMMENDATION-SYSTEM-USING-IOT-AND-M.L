The Agricultural Crop Recommendation System is designed to help farmers make better 
planting decisions using smart technology. It starts with sensors placed in the soil to track 
important factors like nutrient levels (NPK), pH, moisture, temperature, and gases. These 
sensors collect real-time data, giving farmers a clear understanding of their soil’s condition. 
The data is then sent to an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which transmits it to the cloud using 
an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. The system is programmed to ensure smooth communication 
between the hardware and cloud storage, making it easy to process and analyze the 
information. 
Once collected, the data is cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. Then, machine 
learning algorithms analyze it to determine the best crops for the soil and climate conditions. 
The system is trained using historical data and fine-tuned for accuracy with Python and SciKit- 
Learn libraries. 
 
To make the recommendations easily accessible, a web-based platform displays real-time 
sensor readings and suggests the most suitable crops for each farm. The system even ranks 
crops based on soil fertility, weather patterns, and available resources, helping farmers make 
well-informed choices. By using real-time data and AI-powered insights, this system helps 
farmers increase yields, make better use of their land, and practice more sustainable farming. 
Future improvements could include automated fertilizer recommendations and real-time alerts, 
making modern farming even smarter and more efficient.
  Farming has always been about making the right decisions—what to plant, when to plant, and 
how to manage resources. Traditionally, farmers relied on experience and intuition, but now, 
technology is making those decisions smarter and more accurate. The Agricultural Crop 
Recommendation System uses IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning to help farmers 
choose the best crops for their land based on real-time soil and environmental data. 
 
The system combines hardware and software to collect and analyze data. Sensors placed in the 
soil measure key factors like moisture, pH levels, temperature, and the amount of essential 
nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium). These sensors are connected to an Arduino 
UNO microcontroller, which gathers the data and sends it to a cloud platform (ThingSpeak) via a 
Wi-Fi module. 
 
On the software side, the data is processed and analyzed using Python-based tools like Scikit- 
Learn and Pandas. This ensures that any errors or inconsistencies in the data are filtered out 
before making predictions. Machine learning models are then used to analyze soil conditions and 
recommend the most suitable crops. To determine which crops would grow best in a given field, 
different machine learning models were tested, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model stood out with the highest 
accuracy (92.7%), making it the most reliable for predicting crops. In contrast, the Naïve Bayes 
model didn’t perform well with complex data. 
 
The system also helps visualize important trends using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn. For 
example, it showed that soil moisture levels change with irrigation and weather, while pH levels 
remain mostly stable. Higher nutrient levels, as detected by the NPK sensor, were linked to 
better crop yields. Compared to traditional methods, this technology-driven approach improved 
crop selection accuracy by 30-40%. When tested in real farming conditions, the system proved 
to be highly beneficial. Farmers who followed the recommendations saw increased yields, lower 
fertilizer costs, and better water management.
  However, there were some challenges. Sensors needed occasional calibration to maintain 
accuracy, and poor internet access in rural areas sometimes made it difficult to retrieve cloud- 
based data. Additionally, the initial version of the system provided general recommendations, 
which could be improved by incorporating more location-specific agricultural data. The system 
also relies on a stable power supply, which can be a challenge in remote areas. 
 
Despite these hurdles, this technology has the potential to transform agriculture by making data- 
driven decisions accessible to farmers everywhere. Future improvements could include AI- 
powered fertilizer recommendations, integration with weather forecasting, and offline 
functionality to reduce dependence on the internet. 
By using IoT and machine learning, this system is paving the way for smarter, more efficient, 
and more sustainable farming. With better crop choices and optimized resource use, farmers can 
improve yields, reduce costs, and contribute to a more resilient agricultural industry.
